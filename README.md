# Elebris-Adventures
 
This is my ongoing project to create a game that captures many of the elements I enjoyed in Shining souls II, Secrets of Mana, Legend of Zelda. All of these work as the base, but I intend to put a series of unique twists on top of that foundation.

Complete:
- Basic Character Movement, with the new input system and the ability to slot in AI units as well
- Basic Character Animation
- Tilemap Added, Sandbox Created
